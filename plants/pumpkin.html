                <h2>How to Grow Pumpkins</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Pumpkins prefer rich, well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter. A pH of 6.0 to 7.5 is ideal for growing pumpkins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Pumpkins need full sun, ideally at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. They require long, warm growing conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Pumpkins require regular watering, especially during fruit formation. Water deeply once or twice a week to keep the soil moist, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plant Spacing:</strong> Pumpkins need plenty of space to grow due to their sprawling vines. Space plants 4 to 5 feet apart in rows that are 6 to 10 feet apart. Smaller varieties can be spaced closer together, while giant pumpkins need even more room.</li>
                    <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Pumpkins are ready to harvest when they have fully developed color and the rind is hard. Cut the stem about 3 to 4 inches above the fruit, leaving enough stem to prevent rotting.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best Time to Plant:</strong> In northern Minnesota, plant pumpkins in late May to early June, after all danger of frost has passed. If you are starting seeds indoors, begin 2 to 4 weeks before the last frost date (around mid-April).</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Pumpkins take 90 to 120 days to mature, depending on the variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>End-of-Season Tips:</strong> In late summer or early fall, as the vines begin to die back, protect pumpkins from early frosts by covering them with blankets or row covers. Harvest all pumpkins before the first hard frost, as frost can damage the fruit.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Storage Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fresh Pumpkins:</strong> Store pumpkins in a cool, dry place. They can last for 2 to 3 months if kept in optimal conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserving:</strong> Pumpkins can be cooked and frozen for long-term storage. To freeze, puree the cooked pumpkin flesh and store it in airtight containers or bags. Pumpkin seeds can be dried and stored for several months.</li>
