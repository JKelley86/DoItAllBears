            <h2>How to Grow Tomatoes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Tomatoes thrive in well-drained soil rich in organic matter, with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Tomatoes need full sun, with at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water tomatoes deeply and consistently, keeping the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Mulching can help retain moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Tomato plants often need support such as stakes, cages, or trellises to keep the fruits off the ground and prevent damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Pick tomatoes when they are firm and fully colored, but before they over-ripen. Some varieties can be harvested while still slightly green and allowed to ripen indoors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Specific Tips for Northern MN</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Time to Plant:</strong> In northern Minnesota, start tomato seeds indoors about 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost date, typically around late March. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the last frost, usually in late May or early June, when the soil has warmed to at least 60Â°F.</li>
                <li><strong>Average Growth Time:</strong> Depending on the variety, tomatoes typically take 60 to 85 days from transplanting to reach maturity.</li>
                <li><strong>Winterizing Tips:</strong> Tomatoes are annuals and won't survive the winter outdoors. At the end of the growing season (typically in late September), pick any green tomatoes before the first frost. You can ripen them indoors or preserve them by canning or freezing. Remove and compost old plants to prevent disease buildup for the next year.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Harvesting Rosemary</h2>
            <p>Snip the stems as needed, starting when the plant is large enough to withstand light pruning. You can harvest rosemary throughout the growing season and dry or freeze it for later use.</p>

        <section class="information-section">
            <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
            <p>Tomatoes are rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as antioxidants such as lycopene, which has been linked to heart health and cancer prevention. They are also low in calories and high in fiber, making them a healthy addition to any diet.</p>
