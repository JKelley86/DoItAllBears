            <li>Premium: Monthly cost of your insurance plan.</li>

            <li>Let’s say you earn $50,000/year and decide to put $3,000 into your FSA. That $3,000 isn’t taxed — so you save about $600–$900 in taxes (depending on your bracket). You can then use that $3,000 throughout the year to pay for eligible medical expenses.</li>
            <li>You decide how much to contribute for the year during open enrollment (before the year starts).</li>

        <p>Taxes are the money collected by federal, state, and local governments to fund services like roads, schools, healthcare, and defense. When you earn income, buy goods, or own property, you generally owe some form of tax.</p>

        <h3>Types of Taxes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Federal Income Tax:</b> Paid to the U.S. government based on your total income.</li>
          <li><b>State Income Tax:</b> Collected by your state (Minnesota has one).</li>
          <li><b>FICA (Social Security & Medicare):</b> Payroll tax that funds retirement and healthcare for seniors.</li>
          <li><b>Sales Tax:</b> Paid when you buy goods or services.</li>
          <li><b>Property Tax:</b> Based on the value of land or buildings you own.</li>
          <li><b>Capital Gains Tax:</b> Paid when you sell investments for profit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Income Tax Works</h3>
        <p>Federal and state income taxes are <b>progressive</b> — higher income means higher tax rates, but only on the portion of income within each bracket.</p>

        <h4>Example (Single Filer - 2025 Federal Rates)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>10% on $0 – $11,600</li>
          <li>12% on $11,601 – $47,150</li>
          <li>22% on $47,151 – $100,525</li>
          <li>24% on $100,526 – $191,950</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you earn $60,000, only the portion above $47,150 is taxed at 22%. You pay roughly 13.8% overall after all brackets are combined.</p>

        <h3>Key Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Gross Income:</b> Your total earnings before taxes or deductions.</li>
          <li><b>Taxable Income:</b> Income left after deductions are subtracted.</li>
          <li><b>Effective Tax Rate:</b> The average percentage you actually pay overall.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Deductions vs. Credits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Deduction:</b> Reduces taxable income (example: 401(k), HSA, or mortgage interest).</li>
          <li><b>Credit:</b> Reduces your final tax bill dollar-for-dollar (example: Child Tax Credit or EV Credit).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Paycheck Taxes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Federal Income Tax:</b> Based on your W-4 withholding form.</li>
          <li><b>State Income Tax:</b> Determined by your state’s rates.</li>
          <li><b>Social Security (6.2%):</b> Funds retiree benefits.</li>
          <li><b>Medicare (1.45%):</b> Funds healthcare for seniors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Minnesota State Income Tax (2025)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>5.35% on income up to $31,690</li>
          <li>6.80% on $31,691 – $104,090</li>
          <li>7.85% on $104,091 – $194,240</li>
          <li>9.85% on income over $194,240</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ways to Reduce Taxes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Contribute to a 401(k), IRA, or HSA to lower taxable income.</li>
          <li>Use an FSA for pre-tax medical or childcare expenses.</li>
          <li>Claim eligible tax credits and deductions.</li>
          <li>Track charitable donations and education expenses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Taxes fund public services and vary by income level.</li>
          <li>Progressive tax brackets mean only part of your income is taxed at higher rates.</li>
          <li>Deductions reduce income before taxes; credits reduce taxes owed.</li>
          <li>Pre-tax accounts like 401(k)s, HSAs, and FSAs are key tools for lowering taxes.</li>
